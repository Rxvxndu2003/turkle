          <h1>Sea Turtle Threats</h1>
          <p>Worldwide, six of the seven sea turtle species are classified as threatened or endangered due to human actions and lifestyles. From getting caught in fishing gear to people eating their meat and eggs, there are lots of ways that these animals are affected by people.If you found this page through the Seaspiracy movie website, please note their information is incorrect and misleading. There is no recent data that suggests 250,000 sea turtles are injured by fishing boats in the US per year. </p>

            <h3>6 TOP THREATS TO SEA TURTLES</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="t-list">
                   <li>Entanglement in fishing gear: Turtles get caught on long-lines, in shrimp nets, and get injured with bomb fishing. 
                   </li> 
                   <li>Consumption and illegal trade of eggs and meat: Turtle eggs are considered to be an aphrodisiac in many places (with no basis in science) and their meat (primarily green turtles) is still consumed, even though both are illegal in most countries.</li> 
                   <li>Coastal development: Building on nesting beaches, mangroves, and other important coastal areas can affect turtles ability to nest and feed and prevent hatchlings from surviving.</li>  
                   <li>Plastic and other marine debris: Turtles eat plastic, get caught in it, have to wade through it in the water and on beaches, and microplastic can affect nests and hatchlings.
                   </li>  
                   <li>Global warming: Rising temperatures increase sand temperatures, which can cause only females to be born. Climate change also impacts sea level rise, which can erode nesting beaches, and cause coral bleaching, an important habitat for hawksbills.</li> 
                   <li>Turtleshell Trade: Hawksbill turtles in many places are prized for their shells, which are used as decorations or turned into products like jewelry and other crafts.</li>

                <h3>Coastal Development</h3>
                <div class="threats-img">

                <p>
                    Coastal development is a broad category which includes an array of human activities including beachfront construction of homes, hotels, restaurants, and roads, often for tourism. Also included are things like beach renourishment, seawall construction, and nearshore dredging and oil platform construction.  Half of the world’s population lives on or within 100 miles of a coastline and this number will likely increase dramatically in the next decade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are several ways to prevent coastal development of turtles. One way is to reduce marine debris that may entangle or be accidentally eaten by sea turtles. Another way is to participate in coastal clean-ups and reduce plastic use to keep our beaches and ocean clean. Protecting nesting areas will prevent coastal development which will eliminate the unavoidable threats with further development. Thankfully, this protection would provide a safer habitat for sea turtles to nest at and encourage higher survival rates for hatchlings2. Another method would be to decrease the artificial light from coastal development.

                    The effects of global warming are having enormous impacts on sea turtles and other wildlife. The rate of global warming far exceeds the abilities of animals to adapt naturally to such dramatic environmental changes. Sea level rise from the melting of polar ice is already contributing to the loss of beach and sea turtle nesting habitat. Weather extremes, also linked to climate change, mean more frequent and severe storms which alter nesting beaches, cause beach erosion, and inundate, or flood sea turtle nests.

                    Global warming is having enormous impacts on sea turtles and other wildlife. The rate of global warming far exceeds the abilities of animals to adapt naturally to such dramatic environmental changes. Sea level rise from the melting of polar ice is already contributing to the loss of beach and sea turtle nesting habitat1. Climate change is exposing sea turtles to even greater existential threats. Sea level rise and stronger storms will erode and destroy their beach habitats. Warming oceans will change ocean currents, potentially introducing sea turtles to new predators and disrupting their food sources

                    Hawksbill sea turtles are critical to the health of coral reefs by consuming sea sponges that compete with coral for space. They are also a favorite of snorkelers and divers and help draw visitors to spots around the world, helping local economies. But the beautiful shell of the hawksbill, used to hide in the colorful reefs, is also a big reason they are endangered. In many places, artisans take the hawksbill shell (also known as "tortoiseshell") to make jewelry and other products for sale to tourists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The trade of tortoiseshell products made from the shells of critically endangered hawksbill sea turtles is illegal but continues to threaten the species around the world.Our Too Rare To Wear program works with the tourism industry and conservation community to help end the trade of tortoiseshell products around the world. One of the challenges with ending the trade is that many people don’t know that it’s illegal or that it comes from endangered animals

                <h3>Ocean Plastic & Sea Turtles</h3>
                <div class="threats-img">

                    Sea turtles are affected by plastic during every stage of their life. They crawl through plastic on the way to the ocean as hatchlings, swim through it while migrating, confuse it for jellyfish (one of their favorite foods), and then crawl back through it as adults. Thousands of sea turtles, whales, and other marine mammals, and more than 1 million seabirds die each year from ocean pollution and ingestion or entanglement in marine debris.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some ways you can help reduce plastic pollution and protect sea turtles:
                   <ul class="th-list">
                        <li>Reduce your use of single-use plastics like straws, bags, and utensils.</li> 
                        <li>Recycle as much as possible.</li> 
                        <li>Participate in beach cleanups.</li>  
                        <li>Use reusable shopping bags instead of plastic bags.</li> 
                        <li>Use reusable water bottles instead of buying bottled water.</li> 
                        <li>Avoid releasing balloons into the air.</li> 
                        <li>Use reusable containers for food instead of disposable ones</li> 
                   </ul>
                </p>
